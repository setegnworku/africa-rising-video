===================================================================================================
SLIDE 1 — THIS IS AFRICA
===================================================================================================
Africa. One billion people. Three hundred million cattle. The greatest genetic diversity on Earth — and the greatest opportunity to win the climate battle.

This is our land. These are our animals. This is our moment.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 2 — STANDING ON THEIR SHOULDERS
===================================================================================================
The world showed us it could be done. Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand — they proved methane is heritable, written in the DNA. And Africa has not been sitting and watching.

Right here at ELRI, we have estimated heritability of methane in African cattle. The Bezos Earth Fund invested. The Global Methane Hub connected us. Now it is our turn — not to follow, but to lead alongside the world.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 3 — AFRICA'S UNTAPPED GENETIC POWER
===================================================================================================
Look at what we have. Nguni. Ankole. Afrikaner. Bonsmara. Zebu.

These breeds carry millions of years of natural selection — forged by heat, drought, and disease. The world has spent billions searching for climate-resilient genetics.

We have them right here. Right here in Africa.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 4 — RESILIENCE
===================================================================================================
Behind every cow is a farmer. A woman who walks kilometres for water. A man who guards his herd through the night.

These farmers do not need our pity. They need our science. They deserve breeding tools that match their courage. Genetic evaluation. Genomic selection. Data-driven decisions. Not someday — now.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 5 — AFRICA UNITE
===================================================================================================
The Global Methane Genetics Initiative — Africa Chapter. Led by Professor Raphael Mrode at ELRI. Five countries. Three regions. One mission.

Kenya. Ethiopia. Burkina Faso. Benin. And South Africa. Over four thousand animals will be phenotyped for methane emissions. Three thousand will be genotyped. One thousand rumen samples will be collected.

This is the beginning of an exciting journey. African scientists. African labs. African data — contributing to global solutions. The journey starts now!

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 6 — PARTNERSHIP, NOT CHARITY
===================================================================================================
No country can do this alone. Kenya needs South Africa. South Africa needs Ethiopia. We all need each other.

And this partnership is a two-way street. Yes, we contribute Africa's data and Africa's breeds to global science. But we also gain — access to global datasets, global expertise, global tools. The Global Methane Hub is built exactly on this principle: open, reciprocal collaboration. We work together, we learn together, we benefit together.

This is not about giving away Africa's genetic resources. This is about building a global commons where Africa is an equal partner — contributing and receiving in equal measure.

Alone we are limited. Together — we are unstoppable.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 7 — VISION FOR THE FUTURE
===================================================================================================
Imagine twenty years from now. African cattle producing more milk with less methane. Farmers choosing the best bulls with data in their hands. Breeding programs across this continent recognized as world-class.

Not imported solutions. African solutions — built by us, for us, with the world. The science is ready. The partnerships are in place. Are we ready? I believe we are.

===================================================================================================
SLIDE 8 — LET US BEGIN — TOGETHER
===================================================================================================
As Nelson Mandela said — it always seems impossible, until it is done.

This workshop is the beginning of a movement. Climate-smart cattle — by Africa, for Africa, with the world. Because the climate does not know borders. The climate belongs to all of us.

Before I close, I want to say something from my heart. I want to sincerely thank the workshop organizers for the kind invitation to be here today, and for their generous support in making my participation possible. This kind of investment — bringing African scientists together in one room — is exactly what builds the collaborations our continent needs. Your belief in this work means more than you know.

I also thank the Global Methane Hub, the Bezos Earth Fund, ELRI, and all partner institutions who make this science possible every day.

And most importantly — I thank each and every one of you. For being here. For caring. For believing that Africa can lead on climate-smart livestock. Because it can. And it will.

Thank you. Enkosi. Dankie. Asante. Ameseginalehu.
