# Climate-Smart Cattle — Africa Rising Together
## Complete Video Speech Script (~4 minutes)
### Presented by Dr. Setegn Worku Alemu | On behalf of Professor Raphael Mrode | ILRI

## SEGMENT 1 [0:00 - 0:20] — THIS IS AFRICA

Africa.

Home to one billion people. Home to three hundred million cattle. Home to the greatest genetic diversity on Earth — and the greatest opportunity to win the climate battle.

Ladies and gentlemen, look around this room. Look at the talent. Look at the determination. This is not a room full of people waiting for solutions. This is a room full of people ready to build them.

This is our land. These are our animals. This is our moment.

---

## SEGMENT 2 [0:20 - 0:50] — STANDING ON THEIR SHOULDERS

Now, let us give credit where credit is due.

The world showed us it could be done. Pioneering countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and many others led the way. They proved methane is heritable — written in the DNA. They proved that genetic selection works across generations.

And let me tell you — Africa has not been sitting and watching. Right here, at ILRI, we have estimated heritability of methane emissions in African cattle. We are not beginners in this science. We are contributors.

Their science inspired us. Our science is now joining theirs.

And then something beautiful happened. The Bezos Earth Fund invested. The Global Methane Hub connected us. They did not say "fix your problems." They said: "We believe in Africa."

Now it is our turn — not to follow, but to lead alongside the world. And my friends — we are not walking. We are running.

---

## SEGMENT 3 [0:50 - 1:20] — AFRICA'S UNTAPPED GENETIC POWER

Now let me show you something the world has been searching for.

Look at what we have. Breeds that survive where others cannot.

Nguni — painted in the colors of the rain. Ankole — crowned with horns that stretch across the plain. Afrikaner — red as the African clay beneath our feet. Bonsmara — built strong for the break of day. Zebu — humped and made to endure what no imported breed can handle.

These are not ordinary cattle. They carry millions of years of natural selection in their DNA. Forged by heat. Forged by drought. Forged by disease.

The world has spent billions searching for climate-resilient genetics. And you know what? We have them right here. Right here in Africa. The question is — what are we going to do with this gift?

---

## SEGMENT 4 [1:20 - 1:50] — RESILIENCE

But let us never forget something.

Behind every cow is a farmer. A woman who walks kilometers to find water. A man who guards his herd through the night with nothing but a stick and his courage.

I know these farmers. I grew up as one of them. A shepherd boy in rural Ethiopia. I know what it means to depend on your animals for everything.

These farmers do not need our pity. They need our science. They deserve breeding tools that match their courage. Genetic evaluation. Genomic selection. Data-driven decisions.

Not someday. Not in ten years. Now.

---

## SEGMENT 5 [1:50 - 2:20] — AFRICA UNITE

And this is exactly what we are doing.

The Global Methane Genetics Initiative — Africa Chapter. Led by the visionary Professor Raphael Mrode at ILRI. A man who has dedicated his career to putting African livestock genetics on the world map.

Five countries. Three regions. One mission.

Kenya. Ethiopia. Burkina Faso. Benin. And yes — South Africa. Your country. Your breeds. Your contribution to this continental movement.

Over four thousand animals measured for methane emissions. One thousand rumen microbiome samples collected. Three thousand animals genotyped.

These are not plans on paper. This is real data. Real science. Real African leadership. African scientists — in African labs — building African solutions.

Can I get some energy for that? African scientists building African solutions!

---

## SEGMENT 6 [2:20 - 2:50] — PARTNERSHIP, NOT CHARITY

But let me be honest with you. No country can do this alone.

Kenya needs South Africa. South Africa needs Ethiopia. Ethiopia needs Burkina Faso. We all need each other.

And we need our global partners too. But let me be very clear about something — this is partnership, not charity. We are not receiving handouts. We are contributing to global science. Africa's data. Africa's breeds. Africa's solutions — shared with the world.

Data crossing borders. Knowledge freely shared. Impact multiplied.

Alone we are limited. But together — together we are unstoppable.

---

## SEGMENT 7 [2:50 - 3:20] — VISION FOR THE FUTURE

Now close your eyes for a moment. Just for a moment.

Imagine twenty years from now. African cattle producing more milk — with less methane. Farmers holding data in their hands — choosing the best bulls with confidence and precision. Breeding programs across this continent recognized as world-class.

Not imported solutions from a distant shore. African solutions. Built by us. For us. With the world.

Young African scientists — some of them maybe sitting in this room right now — leading the next generation of climate-smart livestock research.

This is not a dream. The science is ready. The partnerships are in place. The data is flowing.

The only question is — are we ready? I believe we are. Do you believe it?

---

## SEGMENT 8 [3:20 - 4:00] — LET US BEGIN — TOGETHER

As Nelson Mandela said: "It always seems impossible — until it is done."

This workshop is not just a meeting. It is the beginning of a movement. Climate-smart cattle — by Africa, for Africa, with the world. Because the climate does not know borders. The climate belongs to all of us.

This is our time. This is our journey. Let us begin — together.

Before I close, I want to say something from my heart. I want to sincerely thank the conference organizers for the invitation to be here today and for their generous support in covering all costs to make my participation possible. This kind of investment in bringing African scientists together is exactly what builds the collaborations we need. Your belief in this work means more than you know.

I also want to thank the Global Methane Hub, the Bezos Earth Fund, ILRI, and all the partner institutions who make this work possible every single day.

And most importantly — I want to thank each and every one of you. For being here. For caring. For believing that Africa can lead on climate-smart livestock. Because it can. And it will.

Thank you. Enkosi. Dankie. Asante. Ameseginalehu.

Generate a cinematic, breathtaking aerial photograph of an African sunrise over vast savanna. A large, diverse herd of cattle grazing in golden morning light. Scattered acacia trees casting long shadows. Dramatic orange and gold sky with sun rays piercing through clouds. Birds in flight. The landscape stretches endlessly — conveying the scale and majesty of Africa. Ultra-realistic, National Geographic award-winning quality, 8K resolution.
